<h3>__What I want to get out of this club:__</h3>
I joined this club for the opportunity to gain more technical skills while also
contributing to the journey of an innovative idea.


<h3>__Why I’m interested in entrepreneurship:__</h3>
At this point in time, I’m not actually interested in becoming an entrepreneur myself,
but I admire the fact that entrepreneurs are not afraid to dream big, take risks,
and assume full responsibility for their company’s successes and failures.
