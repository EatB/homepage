Members of Entrepreneurs @ Berkeley recently interviewed Cal alumni and TenOneTen Ventures Managing Partner David Waxman. TenOneTen Venture is a venture capital firm specializing in seed/startup and growth capital investments. Before joining TenOneTen Ventures, Waxman was a serial entrepreneur. He co-founded several companies including Firefly, which was acquired by Microsoft, PeoplePC, which went public and was acquired by EarthLink, and SpotRunner. During the interview, Waxman shared some valuable funding tips along with his advice for student who wants to be an entrepreneur.

Entrepreneurship is a lot of students’ dreams. It is exciting, lucrative and a path that can make a greater impact. However, the truth is that you will face challenges at every turn, including ones that you’ve never even considered; resolving a conflict between your team, uncertain income, funding uncertainty. In the face of such daunting odds, your passion will be your main force that keeps driving you forward. As such Waxman said that passion of the founder is one of the almost important factors when he invests in a startup. An entrepreneur fueled by passion will carve his or her own path through all the challenges that lie ahead.
Besides passion, Waxman also looks for the quality of the team. A startup is nothing without it’s people. While the founder may have a great vision, it is ultimately the team that executes the vision and determines its fate. Finding the right team is crucial for startup development. Waxman suggested that the ideal cofounder or team member is someone who possesses the skills you lack. So make sure you know your strength and weaknesses and utilize the resources around you.  

Waxman also mentioned that the business model, market size, and traction are also the keys to evaluate a startup. Having a business plan in your pitch deck is great start to find investors. Even if you do not need capital rightnow, you can always use it to ask for feedback from professors, founders, investors, and your peers.
Overall, the most important pieces of advice Waxman offered to students who want to be an entrepreneur was to pursue ventures you are truly passionate about.

The interview concluded with a quote that everyone should keep in mind.
 “Do not let anyone to stop you”, Waxman said.
