“Entrepreneurship”, is a word that intrigues me, especially now, because I’m in the Silicon Valley, which is the hub of innovative ideas coming to life! I remember my first experience as an “Entrepreneur” was me trying to make handmade greeting cards when I was 9 or 10 years old, and selling them to my relatives and friends. Although it was a failed attempt, I had gotten my first taste of what it meant to be an entrepreneur. I remember feeling this sense of pride, that I could sell something I had made and could make money out of it (even though I had just earned $3.50) !


Fast forward 10 years later, even though I’m not pursuing a major in business, I still have a streak of entrepreneurial spirit and interest in me. Every morning, on my walk to the gym, I tend to listen to podcasts where people share their success stories on how they built their businesses and companies. And the more I listen to these podcasts, the more I realize that my 10 year old self was just looking at the monetary gain of selling a product. My 20 year old self recognizes that it’s not all about the money, but about the people. “Entrepreneurship” for me has turned more into a way of contributing to society by learning about what their needs are and developing ideas and products that could potentially better their lives. The monetary gain is just part and parcel, of the venture. 
	
For instance, I have always been very passionate about promoting and encouraging students to pursue a career in STEM. As a student who hated math and science in high school, I understand the aversive effect that those classes could have on a student’s impression on picking a STEM related major in college. A combination of bad teachers and lack of patient help, had turned be away from STEM. However, after attending community college for 2 years, and being exposed to some amazing math teachers and good STEM programs I started to enjoy the field more, and decided to major in Applied Math at Berkeley! This experience of mine, made me realize that teachers have a huge impact on how students view STEM, and the proficiency with which they’re able to teach STEM related subjects does matter. 

So, if I were to pursue an entrepreneurial venture, I would definitely like to tinker on a program STEM is promoted through interactive and fun math and science education. And I believe that the experiences and skills that I would gain by being part of Entrepreneurs At Berkeley would help me bring my idea to life someday!
