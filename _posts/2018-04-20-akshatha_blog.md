*“Entrepreneurship”, is a buzzword heard everywhere, especially in a start-up hub like the Bay Area!*
</span>
<p><span style="color: #f2cf4a; font-family: Babas; font-size: 2em;">I remember my first venture as an “Entrepreneur” was when I was 10 years old. I had decided to sell my hand-made greeting cards at my school fair. Although it was a failed attempt, I had gotten my first taste of what it meant to be my own boss! I remember feeling this sense of pride that I could sell something I had made and could make money out of it (even though I had just made $1.50)! </span> </p>

<p><span style="color: #f2cf4a; font-family: Babas; font-size: 2em;">Fast forward to the present, even though I’m not pursuing a major in business, I still have a streak of entrepreneurial spirit in me. Every morning, on my walk to the gym, I tend to listen to podcasts where people share their success stories on how they built their businesses and companies. And the interesting insight that I gained from listening to these podcasts is that, entrepreneurship is a never-ending journey of grit, perseverance and dusting yourself off and trying again. One of the interesting quotes that Sophia Amoruso, founder and host of Girl Boss Radio and founder of a vintage clothing company called “Nasty Gal” said, “Don’t compare your hustle to a highlight reel.”, really struck me. We tend to see the glamorous side of success, but ignore that the behind-the-scenes might have been pretty ugly. This is a fact that I found not only true not only to entrepreneurship, but to life, especially in a competitive and fast paced environment like Berkeley.

So, one of the objectives that I certainly want to gain from the “Entrepreneurs at Berkeley” club, is to gain more of these interesting insights, and apply them to my life. Moreover, I’m just fascinated by the whole start-up culture here and want to know more about it from entrepreneurs and leaders in the industry, and maybe get inspired to make my own start up someday!
