  bio: I am a junior student majoring in Economics. Before transferring to Cal, I created Ohlone Table Tennis Club. I persuaded companies like Google and Yahoo! to sponsor my team and led my team to win the National Collegiate Championships. I was also the Senator of Student Government where I assisted in making decisions that affected club activities. Currently, as the founder and the board member of the Entrepreneur@Berkeley, I believe this club can transform students' business ideas into a reality.
